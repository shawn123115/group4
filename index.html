        the different decision symbols on PHP language which is the Assignment Operators
        (used with numeric values to write to a variable), Arithmetic Operators (used with
        numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations such as addition, subtraction,
        and multiplication), and lastly the Relational and Logical Operators (are used to compare
